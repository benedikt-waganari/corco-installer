Cloud Shell will display this as an interactive tutorial when users click the teardown link.

## 1. Teardown Your AI Ingestion Deployment

This will remove your Corco AI Ingestion deployment from Google Cloud.

### 1.1. What Gets Deleted

By default, the teardown removes ONLY the infrastructure:
- Cloud Functions and schedulers
- Storage buckets (recordings, voice samples)
- Service accounts
- API credentials from Secret Manager

**Your data is preserved by default:**
- BigQuery tables (all communications data)
- Secrets (API keys, credentials)
- Configuration files

### 1.2. Before You Begin

Make sure you have:
- The teardown token from your email or the teardown link
- Access to the Google Cloud project as Owner or Editor

### 1.3. Step 1: Run the Teardown Script

```bash
<walkthrough-spotlight-pointer spotlightId="cloud-shell-terminal">
Click in the terminal below and run:
</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>

./teardown.sh --token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with the token from your teardown link.

The script will:
1. Ask you to confirm by typing the domain name
2. Show exactly what will be deleted
3. Run Terraform destroy to remove infrastructure
4. Notify Corco that teardown is complete

### 1.4. Step 2: Manual Cleanup (Domain-Wide Delegation)

After the automated teardown, you need to manually remove one Google Workspace setting:

1. Open: https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation
2. Find the entry for `gmail-sync-sa@YOUR-PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
3. Click the trash icon to delete it

This is required because Google Workspace doesn't provide an API for Domain-Wide Delegation management.

### 1.5. Optional: Delete Data

If you want to PERMANENTLY delete all your data (this cannot be undone):

```bash
./teardown.sh --token=YOUR_TOKEN --delete-data --delete-secrets --all
```

This will delete:
- All BigQuery tables (communications history)
- All secrets (you'll need to re-enter API keys on reinstall)
- Configuration files

### 1.6. Reinstalling Later

If you want to reinstall:

**If you kept data and secrets (default):**
Just contact your Corco consultant for a new setup link. Your data will still be there.

**If you deleted everything:**
You'll need to:
1. Get a new setup link from your consultant
2. Re-enter all API keys during setup
3. Start with empty BigQuery tables

### 1.7. Need Help?

Contact your Corco consultant or email support@corco.ai
